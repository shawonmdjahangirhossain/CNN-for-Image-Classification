## Overview
The project utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images into predefined categories. CNNs are highly effective for image recognition tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images through convolutional layers.

Key Highlights:
- Preprocessing and loading image datasets.
- Building a CNN architecture using deep learning frameworks.
- Training and testing the model.
- Evaluating performance with metrics like accuracy and loss.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training results.
- **Pandas**: For managing datasets.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and visualization.

---

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available image dataset for classification purposes, such as:
- CIFAR-10
- MNIST
- Custom image dataset (optional)

The dataset must include images organized into labeled categories.

---

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-image-classification.git
   cd cnn-image-classification
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## How to Run
1. Open the **Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the notebook **CNN for Image Classification.ipynb**.
3. Modify the dataset path, hyperparameters, or CNN architecture if necessary.
4. Follow the output and plots to evaluate the model's performance.
